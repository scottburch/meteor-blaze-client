meteor-blaze-client
===================

Temporary standalone blaze until Meteor-UI client is done.

* Compilies html templates
* Includes minimongo 
* Includes Session

See the test directory for an example and look at src/mbc.js for available functions.

NOTE: I am not connected with the meteor project, I have been doing this with spark and wanted to update to use shark.  
      Use at your own risk.  
      

That said, let me know if I can improve this.
